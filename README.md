## 🚀 Features

* **Multi-Vertical Context Switching:** Toggle between "Medicare Qualification" and "Debt Retention" bots to view specific logic flows and KPIs.
* **Interactive Decision Tree:** Clickable conversation nodes that reveal live transcript snippets and decision logic.
* **Real-Time Compliance Engine:** Visual alerts for TCPA consent, sentiment risks, and regulatory disclosures.
* **Performance Metrics:** Live tracking of Active Calls, Average Latency (<800ms targets), and Conversion Rates.
* **Simulated Anomalies:** Visual indicators for latency spikes to demonstrate "problem detection" capabilities.

## 🛠️ Usage

1.  Download `dashboard.html`.
2.  Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Guided Tour:** The dashboard includes an automated tour on launch to highlight key capabilities.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid)
* **Visualization:** Chart.js
* **Icons:** FontAwesome

## 💡 Philosophy

This prototype demonstrates an "Infrastructure-First" approach to Voice AI. In regulated sectors, simply connecting an LLM to a telephony provider isn't enough. You need:
* **Observability:** Knowing *why* a call failed (latency vs. logic).
* **Compliance:** Treating regulatory checks as code.
* **Transparency:** Visualizing the "Black Box" of AI decision-making.
